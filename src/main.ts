Authentication:  
Use the following credentials to log in and obtain a JWT token:  
- Email: test@example.com  
- Password: 12345  

Include the JWT token in the Authorization: Bearer <token> header for all subsequent requests.

Flow of the Plan Generation API:

1. Login & Authentication
   - User logs in with the credentials to receive a JWT token. All other endpoints require this token in the Authorization header.

2. Create Draft Prompt (POST /layer/draft)
   - User submits an initial prompt. The system sends it to the AI agent for evaluation and refinement suggestions.
   - Response may include clarifying questions or improvement suggestions.
   - The draft is saved with status: awaiting_user.

3. Edit / Reply to AI Suggestions (POST /layer/reply)
   - User can edit the prompt or reply to the agentâ€™s clarifications.
   - Each edit is tracked in editHistory.
   - The AI re-evaluates the prompt and may provide further refinements.
   - Repeat until the user confirms the prompt is final.

4. Confirm Final Prompt (POST /layer/reply with action: confirm)
   - User confirms the prompt.
   - Layer status changes to finalized and readyForGeneration: true.
   - Only confirmed prompts can generate final AI output.

5. Generate Final Plan / Response (POST /layer/generate/:id)
   - The system sends the confirmed prompt to the AI agent for the final plan or answer.
   - The AI response is saved in generatedResponse and layer status becomes generated.

6. Fetch Layer Details (GET /layer/:id)
   - Retrieve the current state of a layer, including messages, agent suggestions, edits, and the final AI response (if generated).`,
